# Weather App!

A simple weather app I made in learning react/redux, I should be learning more Redux-thunk and Redux-saga soon.

### Getting Started

If you want to copy this and make it run, you need to first install node/npm on your computer from an easily googleable link. Then just clone this repo, navigate into it, and install necessary packages(react-redux, redux-promise, react-sparklines, lodash, and axios).

```
> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd WeatherApp
> npm install
> npm install --save react-redux redux-promise react-sparklines lodash axios
> npm start
```
